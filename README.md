## Overview
​
### The challenge
​
The purpose of this challenge is to create a regular expression tutorial that describes a particular expression and display the information in a Gist. I chose to learn in detail the regular expression to validate an email address. 
​
### User Story
​
```
AS A web development student
I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines
```

## My process
​
### Built with
​
- Regular Expressions
- Gist

### What I learned
​
I learned regular expression syntax. Regex is a powerful tool that allows users to match a specific pattern in a string. This can usually be done with javascript but it would take several lines of code whereas regex can abridge the code into a few lines. This can be useful to validate an email address or check a password. 

### Continued development
​
There is so much more to learn about regex syntax such as regex methods that would be helpful  such as match() and replace(). It would be useful to be able to easily implement and decipher expressions. I was only able to decipher one particular code but I would like to write my own expressions and use it in a code. 

I would also like to write more gist to showcase and spread what I have learned in this bootcamp.
